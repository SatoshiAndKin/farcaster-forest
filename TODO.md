first, lets get a 2d isometric camera and a green field that fills the window
then add a character
the character should smoothly follow the mouse cursor
we need collision. physics based is probably overkill, but that seems like the point of this
add some random noise for elevation, dirt quality, seeds. then simulate some rain and grow some plants
add some pollinator bugs
add some birds
add some small animals

what systems do tomagachi have?
